## How to use ?
You can find the full documentation here: XXXX

## General principles
- You can look for information about products, including many useful computed values. 
- If you can't get the information on a specific product, you can get your user to send photos and data, that will then be processed by Open Food Facts AI and contributors to get the computed result you want to show them.
- You can also implement the complete flow so that they get immediately the result with some effort on their side.

## Contributing 

### If your users do not expect a specific result immediately (eg. Inventory apps)
- Send photos (front/nutrition/ingredients/packaging): most painless thing for your users
- The Open Food Facts AI Robotoff will generate some derived data from the photos
- Overtime, other apps, and the Open Food Facts community will fill the data gaps

### If your users do expect a result immediately (eg Nutrition apps, Scoring apps…):
- Send nutrition facts + category > get the Nutri-Score
- Send ingredients > get the NOVA group (about food ultra-processing), additives, allergens, normalized ingredients, vegan, vegetarian…
- Send category (strict minimum) + labels + origins of ingredients + packaging (photo and text) > get the Eco-Score (about environmental impact)

## Open Data Licence
The database in under the OdBL. This means attributing the source and also contributing back any additions (photos, data), which this package makes easy to do.
